# Vivid Story Text Reader

A simple application, inspired by [ASTR](https://github.com/050644zf/ArknightsStoryTextReader/), to read visual novels in a more portable format.

The name is derived from its initial purpose, which was to allow me to read [vivid/stasis](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2093940/vividstasis/)'s story on-the-go and without having to jump around in the Node Flowchart. However, in accordance with the [vivid/stasis Derivative Works Policy](https://shrinereport.xyz/policy.html) I currently will not provide vivid/stasis's parsed story files in this repository, as it violates the "no story simulator" policy, nor will I publish the code I used to parse the story files. I have currently not had any contact with any official Hajimeli or SKY HOUR WORKS team members to confirm or deny whether providing the story files or parsing code is permissible. If any Hajimeli or SKY HOUR WORKS employee would like to contact me to fully clarify this matter, my Discord handle is "captaingold1", and my email is "captaingoldone@gmail.com".

On that note, [vivid/stasis](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2093940/vividstasis/) is an amazing game produced by [Hajimeli Studios](https://www.hajimeli.net/)/[Team Vividstasis](https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Team%20Vividstasis), and published by [SKY HOUR WORKS](https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/skyhourworks). This project is **NOT** officially endorsed by or owned by Hajimeli, SKY HOUR WORKS, or any individual contributors associated with vivid/stasis. You should play the game for yourself, and experience its story.

## How it works

It uses manually created (or automatically parsed) JSON files with the text information for a game. If you'd like to see the format, an example file will eventually be included somewhere (TODO: Actually include the example file). I have currently only parsed the story for vivid/stasis, which I cannot provide the files for as stated earlier.
